| April 5  |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 16 |   6-8pm    |                                                            Locked in and coded almost all the functionality (aside from interfacing with the terminal). Fully coded the processes of processing the dictionary, taking the typed word and finding all candidates, then checking edit distances and comparing to a threshold to return. I haven't tested it yet, but it seems like it should work (maybe some bugfixing, but the approach and design should be solid). |
| March 17 | 11-11:50am | Fixed the bug where I un-dynamic'd my dynamic programming by not actually looking at my data structure. Now it's running, but I'm still figuring out a solution for the short-words case. We probably just want to have a situation where if the word is short enough, our candidates are just the shortest words in the dictionary (if someone types in two or three letters, the intended word is probably at most another character or two). Making good progress. |

I've been messing around with things to help give suggestions in cases for very short words (since even with a threshold of one, there are too many bad suggestions) but haven't figured that out quite yet. |
