Fully coded the processes of processing the dictionary, taking the typed word and finding all candidates, then checking edit distances and comparing to a threshold to return. I haven't tested it yet, but it seems like it should work (maybe some bugfixing, but the approach and design should be solid). |

Now it's running, but I'm still figuring out a solution for the short-words case. We probably just want to have a situation where if the word is short enough, our candidates are just the shortest words in the dictionary (if someone types in two or three letters, the intended word is probably at most another character or two). Making good progress. |

I've been messing around with things to help give suggestions in cases for very short words (since even with a threshold of one, there are too many bad suggestions) but haven't figured that out quite yet. |

Messing around with the way the data is processed because it's pretty slow, but I might need to make some changes to the way I calculate candidates since it's taking a little longer than I'd like to spit out results. |
| March 23    |   9:15-9:45pm   | Fixed an error where setting n>2 caused errors when initializing dict. With n=3 instead of n=4, the code runs fast enough that I'm satisfied with it. It's a *little* picky about what words it suggests (ex. in the Canvas screenshot, "menlloo" has the suggestions "mellow" "mellon" and "menlo" but my algorithm only sees "menlo" since the other two only have shared 3-grams, not 4-grams), but I think n=3 is also a little too trigger-happy with what words it suggests, so it's a worthwhile tradeoff IMO. Not sure if I want to submit as-is or work on the short-words situation a little more (since there are a LOT of suggestions even with a threshold of 1, and the order isn't particularly helpful). |

Added things like a max number of suggestions (8), toyed around with the way I deal with small words, and wrote the timecomplexity.txt file. Also made threshold flexible, so it increases past 2 to 3 or 4 for very long words. I probably made a few other small changes that I don't remember at the moment. |
